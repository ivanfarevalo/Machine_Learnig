# Machine_Learnig
The goal is to employ a systematic framework grounded in probabilistic reasoning and optimization, in order to gain a fundamental understanding of the “best” approaches out there for topics such as unsupervised and supervised learning, sparsity-centric techniques, and Monte Carlo techniques.
